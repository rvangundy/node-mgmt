node-mgmt
=========

A project management tool that goes with your project. No need for 3rd party collaboration, project management, or tracking services. This data can now be included internally with your project, stored within the git repository, and run locally. Automatically parses "hashtags" and issue numbers from git logs and displays them using a locally run server instance.

## Installation

Install node-mgmt globally:

```
npm install -g rvangundy/node-mgmt
```

## Usage

Navigate to a project folder containing a git repository. Run mgmt from the command line:

```
$ mgmt
```

The management page should open in your default browser.
